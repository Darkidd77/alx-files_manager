File Management Platform

This project brings together key back-end concepts and skills learnt this term, including authentication, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The aim is to create a simple platform where users can upload, view, and manage files.
Features

    User Authentication
    Secure the platform using token-based authentication.

    File Management
        View a list of all uploaded files with pagination.
        Upload new files.
        Change file permissions to control access.
        View files directly on the platform.

    Image Thumbnails
    Automatically generate thumbnails for image files.

Project Goals

This project helps you practise combining different back-end technologies to build a working platform. You will learn to:

    Set up and manage a Node.js server.
    Use MongoDB to store and retrieve data.
    Work with Redis for caching and background tasks.
    Build secure token-based authentication.
    Handle file uploads and permissions.
    Automate tasks like creating image thumbnails.

Structure

The project is divided into smaller steps, with guidance for each part. You’ll have the flexibility to:

    Try out your own ideas and methods.
    Break down the code into reusable pieces and organise it into folders (e.g., a utils folder for shared tools).

Why Build This?

While similar platforms exist, this project is for learning purposes. It’s a chance to:

    Combine different back-end tools and techniques.
    Build a complete product.
    Understand how to create scalable and well-organised applications.
